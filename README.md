# recovery-tracking

## Description:
Streamlit app to track exertion during recovery from long-covid or other chronic-fatigue-type illnesses. The app calculates recommended time limits for certain activities that change over time based on how the user ranks themself.

## Input File:

csv with headers 'Date', 'Rank', 'Cleaning', 'Gardening', 'Dogs.' Rank is a score out of 10 of how the user is feeling and 'Cleaning', 'Gardening' and 'Dogs' lists the recommended time limits for the corresponding date. 

## Disclaimer:

This app has had no input from medical professionals. The time limit calculations have been done by trial and error in collaboration with my mother. I assume no liability for loss or damage resulting from anyone's reliance on this code.
